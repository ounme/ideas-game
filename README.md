# ideasgame: README


*Agent‑based simulation of idea propagation through personality psychology*


## Overview

**ideasgame** models how ideas spread, transform, and shape communities. The engine combines:
- **Personality traits** (OCEAN + Intelligence);  
- **Idea dynamics** (content, emotional tone, distortion);  
- **Social mechanisms** (influence, adaptation, evolution).

## Key Components

### 1. `Idea` Class
Represents a propagable concept with:
- `core`: textual essence;  
- `effects`: parameter impacts (e.g., `{'C': +8, 'A': +5}`);  
- `complexity`: 0–100 (affects distortion during transmission);  
- `emotion`: emotional tone (e.g., "reverence");  
- `weight`: idea’s strength in the community (grows with adoption).

### 2. `Agent` Class
Each agent has 6 traits (0–100):
- **O** (Openness) — receptiveness to new experiences;  
- **C** (Conscientiousness) — rule‑following, reliability;  
- **E** (Extraversion) — social activity;  
- **A** (Agreeableness) — empathy, kindness;  
- **N** (Neuroticism) — sensitivity to threats;  
- **I** (Intelligence) — critical thinking.

**Core methods**:
- `calculate_social_weight()`: computes influence (E×0.4 + C×0.3 + I×0.3);  
- `transmit_idea()`: sends idea with distortion and adaptation;  
- `adapt_idea()`: modifies idea based on source/recipient traits;  
- `receive_idea()`: applies effects with filters (e.g., high C resists negative changes);  
- `evolve_idea()`: updates idea complexity and emotion post‑transmission.

### 3. `Community` Class
Manages the agent population and simulation:
- `add_idea()`: injects new ideas into the system;  
- `step()`: runs one simulation cycle (source → recipient selection → transmission → update);  
- `update_history()`: records average trait values;  
- `plot_history()`: visualizes parameter trends.

## Simulation Workflow

1. **Initialization**  
   - Create `Community(size=N)`;  
   - Add initial `Idea` instances.

2. **Cycle (`step()`)**  
   a. Random **source agent** selected (must hold ideas);  
   b. Random **idea** chosen from source’s beliefs;  
   c. **Recipient** selected via weighted probability (source’s E × recipient’s A);  
   d. **Transmission**:  
      - Distortion applied (based on idea complexity and source I);  
      - Idea adapted to source/recipient traits;  
      - Recipient updates traits and adopts idea;  
      - Idea evolves (complexity/emotion changes).  
   e. Trait averages logged.

3. **Termination**  
   - After `num_steps`, plot results and print statistics.


## Output

1. **Console Log**  
   ```
   Шаг 0: средний O=49.4, C=48.9, E=50.0  
   ...  
   Симуляция завершена (100 шагов).
   ```

2. **Graphs**  
   - Line chart of average OCEAN+I values over steps.

3. **Final Statistics**  
   - Mean/min/max for each trait across agents;  
   - Idea adoption rates (e.g., *"Соблюдай завет": 22/30 agents*);  
   - Top 5 social leaders (by `social_weight`).


## Usage

1. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

2. **Run simulation**  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Customize**  
   - Modify `Community(size)` and initial ideas in the `__main__` block;  
   - Adjust idea `effects`, `complexity`, and `emotion` values.

## Parameters & Tuning

- **Agent traits**: Initialized randomly within ranges (e.g., O: 30–70);  
- **Distortion**: `±0.1 × (complexity / 100)`, reduced by source I, increased by recipient N;  
- **Adaptation rules**:  
  - High A (source) → softens core text;  
  - Low O (recipient) → lowers complexity;  
  - High N (recipient) → intensifies emotion;  
- **Idea evolution**: `weight × 1.01` per transmission; complexity ±5% based on source O.
